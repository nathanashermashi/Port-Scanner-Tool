## 🚀 Features
- Scans common ports (21/FTP, 22/SSH, 80/HTTP, 443/HTTPS)
- Configurable timeout settings
- Clear terminal output
- Easy to extend for custom scans

## 📦 Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Port-Scanner-Tool.git
cd Port-Scanner-Tool
```

## 🛠️ Usage
Basic scan:
```bash
python3 port_scanner.py
```

Custom target/ports (edit script):
```python
target = "your-target.com"  # Change this
ports = [22, 80, 8080, 3306]  # Add/remove ports
```

## 📸 Sample Output
```
🚨 Port 22 is OPEN
🚨 Port 80 is OPEN
🚨 Port 443 is OPEN
```

## 🧠 How It Works
1. Creates TCP sockets for each port
2. Attempts connection with 1-second timeout
3. Reports open ports with visual indicators

     ```

2. **Add requirements.txt**:  
   Create file with:
   ```text

   ```

3. **Make it executable**:  
   Add this at the top of `port_scanner.py`:
   ```python
   #!/usr/bin/env python3
   ```
   Then run:
   ```bash
   chmod +x port_scanner.py  # Make executable
   ./port_scanner.py         # Run directly
   ```
